            <p>Oh, boys, don​'t be sentimental; it​'s bad for the digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!</p>
            <stage>(Sings, and all follow)</stage>
            <l>Our captain stood upon the deck,</l>
            <l>A spy​-glass in his hand,</l>
            <l>A​-viewing of those gallant whales</l>
            <l>That blew at every strand.</l>
            <l>Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,</l>
            <l>And by your braces stand,</l>
            <l>And we​'ll have one of those fine whales,</l>
            <l>Hand, boys, over hand!</l>
            <l>So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!</l>
            <l>While the bold harpooneer is striking the whale!</l>

            <p>Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d​'ye hear, bell​-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me call the watch. I​'ve the sort of mouth for that​--the hogshead mouth. So, so, <stage>(thrusts his head down the scuttle,)</stage>
            Star​-bo​-l-e​-e-n​-s, a​-h-o​-y! Eight bells there below! Tumble up!</p>

            <p>Grand snoozing to​-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark this in our old Mogul​'s wine; it​'s quite as deadening to some as filliping to others. We sing; they sleep​--ay, lie down there, like ground​-tier butts. At 'em again! There, take this copper​-pump, and hail 'em through it. Tell 'em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell 'em it​'s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment. That​'s the way--<emph>that</emph>
            's it; thy throat ain​'t spoiled with eating Amsterdam butter.</p>

            <p>Hist, boys! let​'s have a jig or two before we ride to anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!</p>

            <speaker>French sailor.</speaker>
            <p>Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I say; merry​'s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won​'t you dance? Form, now, Indian​-file, and gallop into the double​-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs! legs!</p>
